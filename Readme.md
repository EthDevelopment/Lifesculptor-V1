0) Scope for v0.1 (MVP)

Track personal finances locally (offline-first) with fast CRUD and clear summaries. No bank connections. Manual transactions only. Import/Export CSV. Basic forecasting (straight-line) and payoff calculators. Ship a single-page app with client-side persistence; keep a clean path to later add a backend.

Must‑haves

Accounts (cash, bank, credit card, savings, investments)

Transactions (income/expense/transfer) with categories & tags

Category system (flat for MVP; hierarchy later)

Budgets (monthly per category) — optional display in v0.1, full editing in v0.2

Dashboard KPIs: Net worth, monthly income, expenses, savings rate, credit utilization

Charts: history (balance over time), cashflow bar chart

Forecast (simple): project net worth 6–24 months using average monthly delta

Debt/CC APR tools: payoff calculator, snowball/AVALANCHE suggestion

CSV import/export

Dark UI with the look of the Lovable preview

Nice‑to‑haves (v0.2+)

Goals tracking, scenario planner, emojis for categories, multi‑currency, recurring txns, custom reports
